FindYourBuddy is an app designed to connect riders visiting the Sea to Sky area who are looking to meet others for mountain biking or skiing/snowboarding. As both a Mountain Bike and Snowboard Instructor, I’ve seen many visitors come to this beautiful place, excited to ride, but not knowing anyone to join them. That’s why I created this app — to help people find riding buddies and make the most of their experience
After signing up, you can log in and start exploring. The first section you'll see is the "Pool," where all user posts are displayed. Each post has its own chat feature, which you can join by clicking the "Join" button. This allows you to chat with the host of the post and others who are interested in the same activity.
You can filter posts, chats you're part of, and your own posts. Additionally, you have the ability to edit or delete posts, chats, and update your profile as needed. If you'd like to host your own event, simply click the "Keen for a Plan" button, where you can add a location, title, and details of your plan.
